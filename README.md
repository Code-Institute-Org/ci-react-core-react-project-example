# React Project Example

To use this repository:
1. Click the **Use this template** button in the upper right.
2. Choose a name for your repository and create it.
3. In your own repository, click the green **Code** button. Select the **HTTPS** tab, then copy the repo URL to the clipboard.
4. On your machine, create a new folder and open it in your IDE.
5. In your IDE, open a terminal (**Terminal > New Terminal** from the top toolbar).
6. In the IDE terminal, use `git clone` with the copied repo URL to clone the repo into your workspace:   

    `git clone <your_repo_url> .`

    _Donâ€™t forget the dot (`.`) at the end, to clone the repo into the current directory!_
6. In your IDE, make sure that Node.js **v16** is installed and activated/selected.
